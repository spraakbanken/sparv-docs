Sparv is Spr√•kbanken's annotation tool and contains a corpus
import pipeline and a web service including a web interface.

[Sparv's interface](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sparv/)
(which was previously called Annotation Laboratory)
offers an easy way to quickly annotate shorter texts using
the same tools as are applied in the annotation of the corpora in Korp.

The documentation to the Sparv web service (API) can be found
