Sparv is Språkbanken's annotation tool and contains a corpus
import pipeline and a web service including a web interface.

[Sparv's web interface](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sparv/)
(which was previously called Annotation Laboratory)
offers an easy way to annotate shorter texts using
the same tools as are applied in the annotation of the corpora in Korp.
