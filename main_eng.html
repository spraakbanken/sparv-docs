<p>Sparv is Spr√•kbanken's annotation tool and contains a corpus
import pipeline and a web service including a web interface.</p>

<p><a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/sparv/">Sparv's web interface</a>
(which was previously called Annotation Laboratory)
offers an easy way to quickly annotate shorter texts using
the same tools as are applied in the annotation of the corpora in Korp.</p>
