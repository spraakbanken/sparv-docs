Older Swedish texts or texts written in other languages can often be annotated
with a sub set of the above annotation types.

The `msd` annotation for non-Swedish languages is based on different tag sets,
depending on which language is annotated and what annotation tool is being used.
The attribute contains information about the part of speech and in many cases
morphosyntactic information.
The `pos` annotation contains only part-of-speech information and uses the
[universal POS tag set](http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/).
