The texts of the various corpora in Korp have been enriched with information, so called annotation. For most corpora, this has been done automatically, which means that the annotation contains errors. The annotation consists of the following information.


* pos: part of speech, see http://spraakbanken.gu.se/korp/markup/msdtags.html
* msd: morphosyntactic tag, see http://spraakbanken.gu.se/korp/markup/msdtags.html
* lemma: citation form
* lex: lemgram, identifies the inflectional table
* saldo: identifies a sense in Saldo
* prefix: for compounds
* suffix: for compounds
* ref: the position of the word in the sentence
* dephead: dependency head, the ref of the word which the current word modifies or is dependent of
* deprel: dependency relation, the relation of the current word to its dependency head, see http://stp.ling.uu.se/~nivre/swedish_treebank/dep.html
