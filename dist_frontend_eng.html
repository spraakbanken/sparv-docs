<p>This document describes how to get the Sparv frontend up and running on your own machine. Begin by downloading the latest source zip from <a href="https://spraakbanken.gu.se/pub/sparv.dist/sparv_frontend">here</a>. The source code is made available under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>A web server, such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache</a> or equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The frontend comes pre-compiled in the zip and can be installed by simply dropping the <code>dist</code> folder into your web server root. Consult your web server documentation for more details. You will also need to set some configuration variables in <code>dist/config.js</code> in order to point your frontend to the correct backend address and to the address of the default JSON schema file.</p>
